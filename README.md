# F5 iRules for JA4+ Network Fingerprinting

This repo includes iRules for generating JA4+ fingerprints.  Currently, only JA4, JA4T, JA4L, and JA4H fingerprint iRules are provided.  More JA4+ fingerprint iRules *MAY* be added in the future.

> [!WARNING]
>DISCLAIMER: These iRules are provided as-is with no guarantee of performance or functionality.  Use at your own risk.

Disclaimer aside, these iRules have been tested on F5 BIGIPs running TMOS versions 16.1 and 17.1. 

From the [FoxIO JA4+ Repo](https://github.com/FoxIO-LLC/ja4):
>JA4+ is a suite of network fingerprinting methods that are easy to use and easy to share. These methods are both human >and machine readable to facilitate more effective threat-hunting and analysis. The use-cases for these fingerprints >include scanning for threat actors, malware detection, session hijacking prevention, compliance automation, location >tracking, DDoS detection, grouping of threat actors, reverse shell detection, and many more.
